# Klein-Gordon-Operator-from-Metric
This program prints out the Klein-Gordon operator for any spacetime metric. Hopefully physicists will find this useful for checking work involving messy metrics and/or change of variables. The printing is by no means optimized, so I welcome possible improvements.
